# Random String Generator

- Running the jar will provide a popup with your password :)
- Developed with Java 8
- I am in love with try-catch 

# Things in it.
- Copies to clipboard automatically (if you have the permission).
- 156 char limit (Can be changeable, just check line 62)
- MessageDialog option for when it creates the output.
- Stores the output to clipboard.
- Creates a text file that stores the output 

# Todo
- Change colour of the JDialog to grey because having it white is so bright with no lights on.
- Use flatLaF instead of the default look and feel.
- Have a logo in the top left corner of your dialog using FlatLaF.
- Change font using FlatLaF.
- Change Font Size.
- Maybe rewrite comments to be more clear.
