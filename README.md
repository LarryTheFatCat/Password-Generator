# Random String Generator in Java

- Developed with Java 8
- I am in love with try-catch

# Todo List
- Input asking if you want a custom tag file (JSON, TXR, XML, YAML, etc.)
- Implement a way to automatically close out of the JOptionPane if the user does not click Ok in a specific amount of time.
