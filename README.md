# Random String Generator

- Running the jar will provide a popup with your password :)
- Developed with Java 8
- I am in love with try-catch 


# Things in it.

- 156 char limit (Can be changeable, just check line 62)
- MessageDialog option for when it creates the output
- Stores the output to clipboard 
- Creates a text file that stores the output

# Todo
- Figure out when closing the JOptionpane, it opens another one up asking if you want it copied to clipboard, then using that action event we can copy it to clipboard lol

# Credit

- LazzzyJava for helping with storing the output into your clipboard :)
