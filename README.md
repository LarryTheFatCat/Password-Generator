# Random String Generator

- Running the jar will provide a popup with your password :)
- Developed with Java 8
- I am in love with try-catch 

# Things in it.
- Copies to clipboard automatically (if you have the permission).
- 156 char limit (Can be changeable, just check line 62)
- MessageDialog option for when it creates the output.
- Stores the output to clipboard.
- Creates a text file that stores the output 

# Todo
- Change the output to a JSON file.
- use PrintWriter to print txt in there storing output of randomString.
- Include new dialogs in case it works or not.
- Include the option to copy to clipboard or not. <- that's done already.
- Check if the file is already in your directory, if it is then provide a Dialog saying that it is already there.
