# Random String Generator

- Running the jar will provide a popup with your password :)
- Developed with Java 8
- I am in love with try-catch 


# Things in it.

- 156 char limit (can be below 156 but nothing above)
- MessageDialog option for when it creates the output
- Copies the output to clipboard 
- Creates a text file containing the output

# Todo
- Nothing is really left, I did what I wanted to do.
